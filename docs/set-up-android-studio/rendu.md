# 1.2 Configurer Android Studio

1. SDK :

SDK stands for Software Development Kit. It's a set of tools, libraries, and documentation that developers use to create software applications for a specific platform, such as a particular operating system, programming language, or framework. SDKs typically include resources like APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), sample code, debugging tools, and other components necessary for software development on that platform. For example, Android SDK is used for developing applications for the Android operating system, while iOS SDK is used for developing applications for the iOS operating system used on Apple devices.

2. Android API Levels:

Android API levels refer to the set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provided by the Android platform for developers to create apps. Each API level represents a version of the Android operating system, along with the corresponding features, capabilities, and changes introduced.

Here are the key points about Android API levels:

- Versioning: 

Each Android version is assigned a unique integer value known as the API level. For example, Android 11 corresponds to API level 30, Android 10 to API level 29, and so on. This numbering scheme allows developers to target specific versions of the Android platform when building their apps.

- Compatibility: 

Android apps are developed against a specific API level to ensure compatibility with a range of devices running that version of Android. By targeting a specific API level, developers can leverage the features and functionalities available in that version while maintaining backward compatibility with older devices.

- Feature Sets: 

Each API level introduces new features, enhancements, and optimizations to the Android platform. These may include improvements to security, performance, user interface design, system behaviors, and access to hardware components. Developers can take advantage of these features to create more powerful and engaging apps.

- Support Libraries: 

Google provides support libraries and compatibility packages to help developers manage differences between various API levels. These libraries allow developers to access newer features on older versions of Android or provide backward compatibility for features introduced in newer API levels.

- Targeting API Levels: 

When developing an Android app, developers specify the minimum and target API levels in the app's manifest file. The minimum API level indicates the oldest version of Android on which the app can run, while the target API level specifies the version against which the app is optimized.
